BnR-APPnSettings
  BnR = Backup and Restore
  APPnSettings = Apps and Settings
An attempt to make a Windows reinstallation less painful. This project is intended to help back up apps and their settings and restore them after a Windows reinstallation.
Every time you want or even have to reinstall, you automatically think about the next 2 days in which you have to set up your Windows with apps and settings again.
